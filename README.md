# Treble-Transformer

## Description

This project harnesses AI for novel music generation by combining a transformer model with Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO). 

Previous attempts at music generation that used DQN or LSTM-based models produced poor results, which could be attributed to these models' poor memory for musical motifs and structure. While consistency was generally present in local parts of the generated song, there was a consistent lack of an overrarching, consistent theme. For this reason, we suggest the application of PPO as an alternative to DQN which can be used in conjunction with a transformer architecture to overcome these weaknesses. 


## Timeline and deliverables

##### March 9, 2022
* Complete literature review of previous methodologies and implementation details.
* Have transformer implementation half-complete. 
* Have PPO setup half-complete.

##### April 1, 2022 
* Have transformer model fully functional.
* Have one sample song generated.

##### April 8, 2022
* Have a refined transformer model that has generated multiple songs of reasonable quality using PPO. 

##### April 10, 2022 (assuming no extension requested)
* Finalize results and select best sample songs. 
* Finalize paper and presentation materials for final submission.
